# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Pewlett-Hackard is expecting a wave of employees to retire in what they have dubbed the 'silver tsunami.' We have launched an analysis to approximate the number of employees retiring and whom to promote to a mentorship program to assist in training the new hires that will take over the positions left open by the retirees.
## Results
* ![unique_titles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101011641/165008137-69e042a7-15fe-4cf2-94ab-5d7051d2415b.png) There will be an approximate total of 72,458 people retiring from Pewlett-Hackard in the near future with that many jobs to fill in that time.
* The largest need is going to be in the Senior Engineer category, with 25,916 jobs that will need filled, more than a third of the potential open positions expected.
* Based on a birth date of anytime in 1965, Pewlett-Hackard has identified 1,549 people eligible for the mentorship program, a program designed to find people to mentor the new hires when the retirement wave passes.
* Based on a quick analysis of the csv created for the mentorship eligibility program, all job titles have been accounted for with the exception of "Manager".
## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
A total of 72,458 roles will need filled when the silver tsunami happens.
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Because only people born in 1965 are considered to be in the mentorship eligibilty program, only 1,549 people will be training roles for 72,458 positions. Distributed evenly, that is approximately 47 people per mentor, which sounds like a recipe for disaster. We will either need to pull from a larger pool of employees (perhaps 1965-1967) or begin hiring sooner and in smaller chunks to ensure there is adequate avaiable mentors for the trainees.
